h1. Sidekick

"Sidekick":http://ibuildlegobricks.tumblr.com/post/1398895151/automate-common-tasks-with-sidekick is a command line tool to automatically trigger actions on certain events, as defined per project, in a local @.sidekick@ file in your project folder:

<pre><code>
watch('**/*.rb') { restart_passenger }

auto_compile 'assets/*.sass', 'public/:name.css'

every(10) { notify sh 'fortune' }
</pre></code>

h3. Sample use cases

* Restart server when code is changed
* Auto-compile Sass or CoffeeScript templates (and many other languages)
* Periodically run commands
* Continuous testing, notifications, hooks, you name it

h3. Features

* Simple and powerful DSL
* Easy to extend
* Compiles many formats, thanks to "Tilt":http://github.com/rtomayko/tilt.
* Powered by "EventMachine":http://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine
* The core is about 60 lines of code

You should "read the annotated source code":http://jbe.github.com/sidekick/.

h2. Basic usage

Install with @gem install sidekick@ and invoke the @sidekick@ command in your project folder. If you do not have a @.sidekick@ file, you will be offered a template.

For now, look to the source code to see all available

* "triggers":http://jbe.github.com/sidekick/triggers.html

* "helpers":http://jbe.github.com/sidekick/helpers.html

h2. Writing extensions

h3. Writing new helpers

To add more helpers, simply add methods to @Sidekick::Helpers@, like this:

<pre>
<code lang='ruby'>
  module Sidekick::Helpers
    def make_pickle
      PickeFactory.manufacture!
    end
  end
</code>
</pre>

They will be available to other helpers and to @.sidekick@ files. When adding a group of methods it may be cleaner to write a module under @Sidekick::Helpers@, and then including it.


h3. Writing new triggers

Have a look at the "existing triggers":http://jbe.github.com/sidekick/triggers.html, and you will get the idea. Basically, you define new triggers by calling @Sidekick::Triggers.register(:trigger_name) { .. }@, and hooking into EventMachine the same way as in @EM.run { .. }@ from there.

You can keep your extensions in the @.sidekick@ file itself, or package them in gems, or (better) ask me to merge them into the main repository.
